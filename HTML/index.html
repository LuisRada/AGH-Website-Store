				<h2>Who are we?</h2>
				<p>The AGH University of Krakow (AGH University) is a modern university that actively participates in fostering a knowledge-based society and creating innovative technologies. Our university has a well-established position in the country and is recognised abroad. Experienced staff, advanced laboratories, a unique campus, and, above all, the bonds that connect the AGH University community are our greatest assets.</p>
			</article>

			<article>
				<h2>Campus</h2>
				<p>A unique feature of our campus, compared to other Polish universities, is primarily the fact that the teaching and research facilities, the main offices of faculties, administration and student organisations, as well as the AGH University Student Campus with all its clubs, sports, and recreation facilities are all located in one district of the city, creating a 40-hectare hub nestled in the heart of Krakow. It is only a 15-minute walk between the Main Building and the Krakow Main Square.</p>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>The AGH University of Krakow carries out projects funded by the Ministry of Education and Science, the European Commission, the National Science Centre, the National Centre for Research and Development, and the Polish National Agency for Academic Exchange.
				Our scientists investigate the world and create inventions and breakthrough solutions for the benefit of the economy and society. The AGH University projects emerge to meet the needs of industry, business, and administration. Through participation in Polish and international associations, consortia, and organisations, we take part in the most important scientific initiatives, contributing to the development of strategic research projects.</p>

				<h2>International cooperation</h2>
				<p>The university has 600 student exchange agreements and 31 double degree agreements (including 1 concluded within the framework of the prestigious T.I.M.E. programme).
				Each year, nearly 700 students (arriving and leaving) and 130 employees (research trips) participate in academic exchanges within the framework of the Erasmus+ programme.
				The AGH University often hosts lecturers from abroad, i.e. Visiting Professors. In the academic year 2020/2021, 15 prominent scientists and popularizers from all over the world have come to lecture at our university.</p>
