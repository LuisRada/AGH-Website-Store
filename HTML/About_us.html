				<h2>History of the AGH University</h2>
				<p>The efforts to establish a Polish mining school in Krakow and to appoint suitable teaching staff began in the second half of the 19th century and intensified when Galicia gained autonomy in 1860. Numerous projects were developed that considered, among other things, the creation of an independent mining academy or a faculty of mining at the Lviv Polytechnic or the Technical Institute in Krakow.
				At the beginning of the 20th century, a group of prominent engineers and mining activists, led by Jan Zarański, went to great lengths to obtain approval for establishing a higher education institution in Krakow to educate mining engineers. Concentrated diplomatic action was taken in Vienna to win the favour of the Austrian government.
				These efforts were successful, and on July 10, 1912, Krakow authorities received a permit to establish a mining academy.</p>

				<h2>1913 – establishment of the Mining Academy</h2>
				<p>In April 1913, the Ministry of Civil Engineering in Vienna appointed the Organising Committee of the Mining Academy in Krakow, chaired by Professor Józef Morozewicz. The document that confirmed the establishment of a higher school of mining in Krakow was signed on May 31, 1913 by emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria.
				The outbreak of World War I made it impossible to inaugurate the first academic year of the newly-established academy in October 1914. The minutes from a conference at the President of Krakow, Juliusz Leo, contain a footnote related to the Mining Academy. A magistrate official, probably reorganising documents, wrote an additional note at the bottom of one of them that said: ‘Due to the outbreak of war, the Mining Academy was not opened, the whole matter being postponed to more peaceful times, 21st March 2015.’</p>

				<h2>1919 – opening of the academy</h2>
				<p>When Poland regained its independence in 1918, the Organising Committee of the Mining Academy in Krakow recommenced its work.
				On April 8, 1919, the Council of Ministers put forward an official motion to establish and open the Mining Academy in Krakow.
				On May 1, 1919, the first six professors of the Mining Academy were appointed. 
				On October 20, 1919, Józef Piłsudski officiated a celebratory inauguration of the Mining Academy in the main hall of the Jagiellonian University.</p>
